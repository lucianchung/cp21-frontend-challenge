Checkpoint 21 - Frontend Challenge: Coding a bus list-view for BusyBus

This a project for a Design Apprenticeship at Bloc.

## Summary
BusyBus is an app that informs bus riders of the next arriving buses at a given bus stop. It provides details such as a visual map, bus number, next bus stop, bus direction, and how much time until the bus arrives. This repository contains HTML and CSS for a prototype showcasing the visuals of BusyBus.

### Task:
Create a mobile app called BusyBus, an application operated by a city transit system that serves thousands of commuters in a large city.

### Problem:
Numerous bus routes have been recently added and many of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop.

### Goals:
BusyBus should:
- inform riders what the next arriving bus is at a given stop
- inform riders how much time until a bus arrives at a stop
